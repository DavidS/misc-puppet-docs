New Deprecations
===
This contains a list of deprecations that should be added to a release prior to Puppet 4.
For each issue there is a brief discussion / motivation and implementation suggestion

class is not a valid name for a class
---
The keyword "class" is specifically allowed in the grammar and then becomes a string just
like any other name. The deprecation can most cleanly be done in the grammar itself and
this is also the point of origin for this feature.


periods in names ?
---
Investigate

upper case variable names ?
---
Variables that start with an upper case letter are problematic when they are interpolated.
The current 4x implementation validates them as invalid for sake of consistent naming (all initial
UC segments is a reference to type and lower case to an instance). With an uc variables something like $a::B is an error since another rules says that each segment must start with the same case. 

It is thus impossible to refer to this variable from the outside. (That may be a feature in its
own right :-) but a very odd way of providing this.

Again, the easiest deprecation is probably in the grammar.

access to non existing variables
---
There is a strict mode that can be turned on for variables. It performs a throw if the flag is turned on. It could be changed to always throw, then catch it, issue warning if flag is off and return undef.

access to classes using uc class name/title
---
3.x allows a reference such as Class[Foo] to mean the class named 'foo'. This is
inconsistent since just a Foo is a reference to a resource type. The use of uc name
as class 'title' should be deprecated. (It is found in several tests).

Older Deprecations to remove in 4x.
===
Here is a list of old behavior / deprecations that should not be removed.

hyphens in names
---
This is already deprecated

Ruby DSL
---
Support for Ruby DSL can be removed.
