Expressions
===
L, R, and Non Value Expression
---
A Puppet Program consists of a sequence of Expressions. There are three main kinds of expressions;

* R-value expressions that produce a result (of some type)
* L-value expressions that provide an assignable "slot"
* non-value producing expressions

### L-value Expressions

The L-value expressions are:

* `Variable` when being LHS in an `AssignmentExpression` (operators `=`, `+=`, and `-=`)
* `Name` when being LHS in an `AttributeOperationExpression` (operators `=>`, and `+>` in a
  `ResourceBodyExpression`.
  
<table><tr><th>Note</th></tr>
<tr><td>
  Versions of the Puppet Programming Language before 4x allowed assignment to unassigned slots
  in <code>Array</code> and <code>Hash</code> values - i.e. an <code>AccessExpression</code>
  (e.g. <code>$a[1]</code>) was also an L-value. This is no longer supported - all variables
  and values are strictly immutable.
</td></tr>
</table>

### "Non-Value" Producing Expressions

Non-Value Producing Expressions always produce the special value `undef`. The term "statement" or
"procedure" may also be used to denote such expressions depending on their role.

The following are non-value producing expressions:

* Calls to functions that are marked to be of `statement` kind.
* Collect expressions (operators `<| |>` and `<<| |>>`)
* ClassDefinition
* ResourceTypeDefinition

The result of these expressions are the side effects they have on the state of the compilation.

### R-Value Expressions

All other expressions produce a value.

Literal Value Expressions
---
### Numbers

    # Integers
    10   # decimal
    0777 # octal
    0xFF # hexadecimal
    
    # Floating Point
    0.1
    31.415e-1
    0.31415e1
     
Numbers are tokens produced by the Lexing of the source text. (TODO: REF TO NUMBER LEXING RULES)

Numbers evaluate to themselves.

### Strings

    # Single quoted strings
    'hello'
    'I take a bit
    more room'
    'He said "hello", but it sounded like \'hell-yo\''
    
    # Double quoted strings
    "You can quote me on that"
    "I keep \t of things around here"
    "I can not drink more than $max_beers beers"
    
A single quoted string is a single token produced by the Lexing of the source text (TODO: REF TO
SQ STRING IN LEXING RULES).

A Single Quoted string evaluates to a runtime String type.

A Double Quoted String is a sequence of text string parts, and expression parts. When evaluated
the text parts evaluate to runtime String type, and the expression parts are first evaluated and the result is converted into a runtime String type. The produced value is the concatenation of
all the produced runtime Strings into a single String.

The text parts of a double quoted string are produced by Lexing of the source text (TODO: REF TO
DQ STRING IN LEXING RULES).

Both types of strings can span multiple lines. When they do, the \r\n or \n line endings are
included in the result. There is no unification of line endings.

#### String Interpolation

String interpolation can be performed two different ways:

* $varname - interpolates the result of referencing the variable named 'varname'
* ${expression} - interpolates the result of evaluating the embedded expression.

The expression part has the following rules:

* Any expression may be interpolated (except Non-Value producing expressions such as
  `define` and `class`)
* Automatic conversion to a variable is performed if the expression is on one of the forms:
  * `${<KEYWORD>}` - e.g. `${node}`, `${class}` becomes `${$node}`, `${$class}`
  * `${<QualifiedName>}` - e.g. `${var}` becomes `${$var}`
  * `${<Number>}` - e.g. `${0}` becomes `${$0}`
* Automatic conversion is also performed in these cases but keywords must be written with
  a preceding $:  
  * `${<AccessExpression>}` - e.g. `${var[key]}`, `${var[key][key]}` becomes `${$var[key]}`,
    `${$var[key][key]}`
  * `${<MethodCall>}` - e.g. `${var.each ...}` becomes `${$var.each}`, which also works for the 
    leftmost name in a sequence of method calls e.g. `${var.fee.foo}` becomes `${$var.fee.foo}`  
* **In all other cases a name or number that should be interpreted as a variable must be
  preceded with a `$`**
  * `${if + 1}` - **error**, i.e. not $if + 1
  * `${2 + 2}` - **is 4**, not $0 + 2
  * `${x + 3}` - **error**, is 'x' + 3, not $x + 3 (error because `+` does not operate on `String`)
  * `${if[2]}` - **error**, since `if` is a keyword and the expression is not just the if-name 
    (causes syntax error since an if expression is allowed, but must have correct syntax e.g.
     `${if true { 'always' } else { 'never'Â }}`

<table><tr><th>Note</th></tr>
<tr><td>
  These rules are different from the rules in Puppet 3x where many constructs did
  not work because of failure to recognize what should <b>not</b> be interpreted 
  as variable reference. Anything but the simplest forms of expression interpolation
  could have surprising effect.
</td></tr>
</table>

The result of the expression is converted to a `String` as specified in the following section.

#### Expression Result to String Conversion

* `undef` is converted to an empty string ''
* `QualifiedName` is converted to the reference in string form
* `QualifiedReference` is converted to string
* `Boolean` is converted to 'true' or 'false' respectively
* A `String` is copied
* A `Numeric` is converted to string using decimal radix (base 10), and uses platform specific
  defaults for conversion of floating points numbers (the result may vary from platform to
  platform)
* Regular Expressions are converted to a regular expression pattern string in transitive form (can
  be converted back to a regular expression again)
* A `Type` is converted to its program source text form
* An `Array` is converted to string by enclosing the contents in `'['` `']'` and then applying the
  conversion rules recursively to each element using `', '` to separate the elements.
* A `Hash` is converted to string by enclosing the contents in `'{'` `'}'` and then applying the
  conversion rules to each element's key and value, producing `<key> '=>' <value>` for each element
  separated by `', '`.
* For `Array` and `Hash`, no trailing comma is produced after the last element.

### Qualified Name

A qualified name evaluates to a string unless it occurs in a context where the name
has specific meaning.

     $a = apache::port # equal to $a = 'apache::port'

### Qualified Reference

A qualified reference evaluates to a Type.

     $a = Integer # a is a reference to the Integer type
     
### Regular Expression

A regular expression pattern evaluates to a runtime regular expression.

     $a = /.*/  # a is a reference to the regular expression
     
Array and Hash Expressions
---
### Array Expression

A "literal" Array has the following syntax:

     LiteralArray: '[' ((Expression (',' Expression)*)? ','?) ']'
     
The expressions are evaluated from left to right, and a runtime array is produced with
the result. 

The Puppet Programming Language '[' token is used in grammatical constructs in a way that
creates an ambiguity. This is resolved by the following rules:

* `[]` as an access operator (getting a 'identified detail' from the LHS) has higher precedence
  than `[]` as a LiteralArray.
* When `[]` appears after a `QualifiedName`, a intermediate whitespace sequence changes the
  lexical meaning of the initial `'['` to mean start of literal array.
* The precedence can be modified by using an expression separator `';'` between the LHS and `'['`.
* A `[]` that appears without a LHS is interpreted as a literal array.

Examples:

     $a = [1, 2, 3] # $a becomes Literal Array of 3 numbers
     $x = $a[1]     # $x becomes 2 (Accessing element at index 1 in the value referenced by $a)
     $x = $a; [1]   # $x becomes the literal array, a literal array containing '1' is the produced
     $x = abc[1]    # $x becomes 'b' (character at index 1 in string 'abc'
     abc [1]        # calls the function abc with the literal array containing '1' as an argument
     
### Hash Expression

A "Literal" Hash has the following syntax.

     LiteralHash: '{' ((HashEntry (',' HashEntry)*)? ','?)) '}'
     HashEntry: Expression '=>' Expression
     
The hash entries are evaluated from left to right, key before value and a runtime hash
object is produced with all of the entries.

Expressions must result in an R-Value.

Operators
---
### + operator
* Performs a concatenate/merge if the LHS is an Array or Hash
* Adds LHS and RHS otherwise
  * LHS and RHS are coerced to Numeric
  * Operation fails if LHS or RHS are not numeric or coercion failed
  
#### Addition

Addition of integer values produces an integer result. If one of the operands is a Float the
result is also a Float. Integral does not overflow.

    1 + 1      # produces 2
    1.0 + 1.0  # produces 2.0

#### Concatenation / Merge

* Concatenates an array or a non array value converted to a single entry array 
  to the end of a new copy of the LHS array.
* If the RHS is a Hash, it is converted to an Array before concatenation (to instead
  concatenate a Hash, use the << operator).
* Merges a Hash by copying the LHS and adding or overwriting keys with the RHS Hash
* If the RHS of a merge is an Array, it is converted to a Hash (the array should be
  on the form `[key, value, key, value, ...]`, or `[[key, value], [key, value], ...]`

Examples

    # LHS must evaluate to an Array or a Hash (or it is a form of arithmetic expression)
    1,2,3] + [4,5,6] => [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    [1,2,3] + 4 => [1,2,3,4]
    [1,2,3] + {a => 10, b => 20} => [1,2,3, [a, 10], [b, 20]]
    {a => 10, b => 20} + {b => 30} => {a => 10, b => 30}
    {a => 10, b => 20} + {c => 30} => {a => 10, b => 30, c => 30}
    {a => 10, b => 20} + 30 => error
    {a => 10, b => 20} + [30] => error
    {a => 10, b => 20} + [c, 30] => {a => 10, b => 20, c => 30}

### - operator

* Performs a delete if the LHS is an Array or Hash
* Subtracts RHS from LHS otherwise
  * LHS and RHS are coerced to Numeric
  * Operation fails if LHS or RHS are not numeric or coercion failed
  
#### Subtraction

Subtraction of integer values produces an integer result. If one of the operands is a Float the
result is also a Float. Integral does not underflow.

    10 - 1     # produces 9
    10.0 - 0.1 # produces 9.9

#### Delete

Deletion produces the LHS \ RHS (set difference).

* Deletes matching entries from the LHS as given by the RHS. A copy of the LHS is first created,
  the original LHS is unchanged. The copy (after deletions) is produced as the result.
* When LHS is an Array, RHS, if not already an array, is transformed to an array and all matching 
  elements are removed (matching is done by equality comparison of each array element).
* When LHS is a Hash;
  * and the RHS is an Array, the entries with keys matching the elements in the array are deleted
  * and the RHS is a Hash, the entries with matching keys are deleted

Examples:
   
    # LHS must evaluate to an Array or a Hash (or it is a form of arithmetic expression)
    [1,2,3,4,5,6] - [4,5,6] => [1,2,3]
    [1,2,3] - 3 => [1,2]
    [1,2,b] - {a => 1, b => 20} => [2]
    {a => 10, b => 20} - {b => 30} => {a => 10}
    {a => 10, b => 20} - a => {b => 20}
    {a => 10, b => 20} - [a,c] => {b => 20}

### unary - operator

* Changes the sign of the operand
  * RHS is coerced to Numeric
  * Operation fails if RHS is not numeric or coercion failed


### * operator

* Multiplies LHS and RHS
  * LHS and RHS are coerced to Numeric
  * Operation fails if LHS or RHS are not numeric or coercion failed

Multiplication of integer values produces an integer result. If one of the operands is a Float the
result is also a Float. Integrals does not overflow.

### / operator

* Divides LHS by RHS
  * LHS and RHS are coerced to Numeric
  * Operation fails if LHS or RHS are not numeric or coercion failed

Division of integer values produces an integer result (without rounding).
If one of the operands is a Float the result is also a Float. Division by 0 is an error.

### % (modulo) operator

* Produces the remainder (modulo) of dividing LHS by RHS
  * LHS and RHS are coerced to Numeric
  * Operation fails if LHS or RHS are not Integer or coercion failed
  
### << operator

* Performs an append if the LHS is an `Array`
* Performs left shift of the LHS by the RHS count of shift steps otherwise
  * LHS and RHS are coerced to Numeric
  * Operation fails if LHS or RHS are not Integer or coercion failed
  * A left shift of a negative count reverses the shift direction

#### Left Shift

Left shift is performed on `Integer` numbers. The LHS is shifted the given amount of bits to the
left. The shift does not overflow.

     1 << 1 # 2
     2 << 2 # 8

#### Append

When the LHS is an `Array`, the RHS is appended to the end of a copy of the LHS, and the result
is produced. The RHS is not converted.

Examples:

     [1,2,3] << 4       # [1,2,3,4]
     [1,2,3] << [4]     # [1,2,3,[4]]
     [1,2,3] << {a=>10} # [1,2,3,{a=>10}]

### >> operator

* Performs right shift of the LHS by the RHS count of shift steps otherwise
  * LHS and RHS are coerced to Numeric
  * Operation fails if LHS or RHS are not Integer or coercion failed
  * A right shift of a negative count reverses the shift direction

Right shift is performed on `Integer` numbers. The LHS is shifted the given amount of bits to the
right. The shift does not overflow. A value smaller than 0 is never produced.

     1 >> 1  # 0
     8 >> 2  # 2
     
### and, or, !, logical operators

The logical connectives `and`, `or` evaluates their LHS and RHS until the truth or falsehood of
the expression is known. Remaining evaluation is skipped.

* The `and` operator produces `true` of both LHS and RHS are "truthy", and `false` otherwise
* The `or` operator produces `true` if either LHS or RHS are "truthy", and `false` otherwise
* The `and` operator has higher precedence than `or`.
* The unary `!` (not) operator reverses its operand, `false` if the operand is "truthy", and `false` 
  otherwise.
* The `!` operator has higher precedence than both `and` and `or`.

Examples:

     true and false  # false
     true or false   # true
     true and 1      # true
     true and ''     # false
     true and !false # true

TODO: REF TO TRUTHY

Equality and Comparison Operators
---
### Equality

#### == operator

Tests if LHS is equal to RHS and produces a Boolean.

* If LHS and RHS are coercible to Number, the equality checks is based on numeric value
* If LHS or RHS is coercible to Number, but not the other, the result is false
* String comparison is done case independently.
* If the base type of LHS and RHS is different the result is false
* Arrays are equal if they have the same size and each element is equal (with the semantics of
  == operator)
* Hashes are equal if they have the same size and each element is equal (with the semantics of
  == operator applied to the values).
* Types are equal if they represent the same type
* RegularExpressions are equal if they have identical pattern
* Booleans are equal if they represent the same value - a boolean is not equal to a truthy value
* All other objects are equal if the underlying runtime representation reports them as equal (safety 
  net)
  
Examples

     true == true  # true
     true == ''    # false
     false == ''   # false
     false == !!'' # true

#### =! operator

Tests if the LHS is not equal to RHS and produces a Boolean.

The logical reverse of the == operator. The same as evaluating `!(LHS == RHS)`.

### Pattern Match

#### =~ match operator

Tests if the LHS matches the RHS regular expression, and returns a Boolean result. As a
side effect the variables $0-$n is set with the matches produced.

* If the RHS evaluates to a String a new Regular Expression is crated with the string value
  as its pattern.
* If the RHS is not a Regular Expression (after String conversion) an error is raised.
* If the LHS is not a String an error is raised. (Note, Numeric values are not coerced to
  String automatically because of unknown radix).
  
The numeric variables $0-$n are set as follows:

* $0 represents the entire matched (sub-) string
* $1 represents the first (leftmost) capture group
* $2-$n represents the subsequent capturing groups enumerated from left to right
* Unmatched sections evaluate to undef
* Numeric variables are not visible from outer scopes
* If a match is performed in an inner scope, it will obscure all numerical variables in outer scopes.

The numeric variables are in scope until the end of the block if the match is performed
without introducing a conditional block, and until the end of the conditional constructs if
such a block is introduced.

Example:

    if abc =~ /(a)b(c)/ {
      # $0 == 'abc', $1 == 'a', $2 == 'c'
    }
    elsif {
      # same as above
    }
    else {
      # same as above
    }
    # $0-$n return to the values they had before the if
    
Example:

    $x = abc =~ /(a)b(c)/
    # $0 == 'abc', $1 == 'a', $2 == 'c' (until end of block)

The setting of match variables is also covered per expression that introduces conditional blocks (if,
elsif, case and selector).


#### !~ match operator

Tests if the LHS does not match the RHS and returns a `Boolean` result. This is the same as evaluating `! (LHS =~ RHS)`. The numerical match variables are set as a side effect.

See =~ operator for detail.

### <, >, <=, >=, comparison operators

Comparisons are done by ordering the LHS and RHS as being less than, equal, or greater than.
A comparison operator converts the result to a Boolean.

* `<` true if LHS is less than RHS
* `>` true if LHS is greater than RHS
* `<=` true if LHS is less than or equal to RHS
* `>=` true if LHS is greater than or equal to RHS

* If `<=` is true so is `<` and `==`
* If `>=` is true so is `>` and `==`

#### Comparison Semantics per type

* If both LHS and RHS are coercible to Numeric the comparison is based on the numeric values
* Comparisons of strings is case independent
* All Numeric values are less than all String values
* Only String and Numeric values can be compared

### IN operator

The `in` operator tests if the LHS operand can be found in the RHS operand. Both LHS and RHS
are evaluated before conducting the test. The result produces a Boolean indicating if the LHS
was considered to be in the RHS.

* A search using regular expression does not affect the match variables $0-$n

Syntax:

    InExpression
      : Expression 'in' Expression

<table><tr><th>Note</th></tr>
<tr><td>
  The <code>in</code> operator in Puppet 3x is a mysterious beast, it does not use the puppet
  rules for equality and results in paradoxes. It is also not very versatile (it allows searching
  for a fixed substring in a string, but not a pattern, a not a substring in a collection
  of strings/keys.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>T.B.Decided</th></tr>
<tr><td>
  The current implementation of 4x performs equality check with the same semantics as the
  <code>==</code> operator (case insensitive). The 3x implementation does not (it is case sensitive).
  If this should be changed, both should change to be strict (case sensitive).
</td></tr></table>

| LHS      | RHS    | Description
| ---      | ---    | ---
| String   | String | searches for the LHS string as a substring in RHS (LHS and RHS downcased), true if a substring is found.
| Number   | String | is only true if the RHS coerced to number equals the number
| Regexp   | String | true if the string matches the regexp ( =~ )
| TypeÂ     | String | only true if the type is `String`, `Data`, or `Object` (rationale 'any substring of string is a string, and a string is also Data'
| Any Other| String | false
| Type     | Array  | true if there is an element that is an instance of the given type
| Regexp   | Array  | true if there is an array element that matches the regexp (=~). Non string elements are skipped.
| Any Other| Array  | true if there is an array element equal (==) to the LHS
| Any      | Hash   | true if the LHS `in` the array of hash keys is true


Assignment Operators
---

The assignment operators assign the RHS (or an assignment operation involving the RHS) to the L-Value produced by the LHS. An L-value is a name referring to a "slot" in the current scope (that can be referenced by a variable to obtain the value).

* A `$` variable produces an L-value name
* Only a simple name is accepted
* Numerical L-values are not allowed (numerical variables are read only and set by side effect
  of matching with a regular expression).

### = operator

Assigns the evaluated RHS value to the given L-value name. The RHS value is produced as the
result. Chained assignments are permitted.

Examples:

    $a = 10
    $x = $y = 0

### += operator

If the L-value name is a reference to a variable in an outer scope, the evaluated RHS
value is concatenated/merged to the value of the outer scope variable and assigned to the L-value name. If the L-value name is not a reference to an outer scope variable the result is the same as if the regular assignment operator had been used.

* The operation fails if the outer scope value is not an array or a hash, or if the corresponding
  `+` concatenation operation fails (see '+' Concatenation).
* The produced result is the evaluated RHS

### -= operator

If the L-value name is a reference to a variable in an outer scope, the evaluated RHS
value is deleted from (a copy of) the value of the outer scope variable and assigned to the L-value name. If the L-value name is not a reference to an outer scope variable the value `undef` is assigned (i.e. deleting something from nothing is undefined).

* The operation fails if the outer scope value is not an array or a hash, or if the corresponding
  `-` (deletion) operation fails (see '-' Delete).
* The produced result is the evaluated RHS

[ ] Access Operator
---
The AccessExpression operator `[]` is one of the most versatile in the Puppet Programming
language. It has different meaning depending on the type of the LHS operand.

The grammar is:

    AccessExpression
     : Expression '[' Expression (',' Expression)* ']'
     ;

The arity of the list of expressions varies with the evaluated type of the LHS. The arity is
never less than 1.

The `[ ]` operator supports access to:

* one or a range of elements from an Array
* one or selection of keys from a Hash
* a single character from a String
* a range of characters (substring) from a String

The `[ ]` operator supports creation of:

* a regexp when applied to a Pattern type
* a specialized type when applied to a more generic type
* a collection of types (for certain types)
* an array of integers given to, from, and optional step

### Array []
Accepts two signatures:

    ArrayAccess
      : SingleElementAccess | ElementRangeAccess
      ;
      
    SingleElementAccess
      : '[' Index ']'
      ;
      
    ElementRangeAccess
      : '[' From ',' To ']'
      ;
    Index: Expression ;
    From: Expression ;
    To: Expression ;
    
    [index]    # element at index
    [from, to] # elements from index to index (inclusive)
    
* Keys (Index, From, To) must evaluate to Integer type
* ElementRangeAccess From and To are inclusive
* Negative indexes enumerate from the end, where -1 is the last element
* Fewer than 1 and more than 2 keys generates an error.
* SingleElementAccess produces the element at the given Index
* ElementRangeAccess produces an Array including the range of elements

Examples:

    [1,2,3][2]      # => 2
    [1,2,3,4][1,2]  # => [2,3]
    [1,2,3][100]    # => nil
    [1,2,3,4][-1]   # => 4
    [1,2,3,4][2,-1] # => [3,4]


### Hash []

Signature:

    HashElementAccess
      : '[' Key (',' Key)* ']'
      ;
    Key : Expression ;

* If a single key is given the result is the lookup of that key
  * If the key does not exist, `undef` is produced.
  * If the value entry is `undef`, `undef` is produced.
* If multiple keys are given, the result is an array with the result of looking up each key
* Non existing keys does not produce entries in the result.
* Value entries that are `undef` does not produce entries in the result.
* Fewer than 1 argument generates an error.

Examples:

    {'a'=>1, 'b'=>2, 'c'=>3}['b']         # => 2
    {'a'=>1, 'b'=>2, 'c'=>3}['b', 'c']    # => [2, 3]
    {'a'=>1, 'b'=>2, 'c'=>3}['x']         # => undef
    {'a'=>1, 'b'=>2, 'c'=>3}['x', 'y']    # => []
    {'a'=>1, 'b'=>2, 'c'=>3}['x', 'b']    # => [2]
    
Note that the result of using multiple keys results in a compacted array where all missing entries
have been removed.

### String []

Access to characters in a string (a substring) have the same semantics as if the string
was an array of the string's individual characters, put produces a string result instead of
an array of single character strings.

Examples:

    "Hello World"[6]    # => "W"
    "Hello World"[1,3]  # => "ell"
    "Hello World"[6,-1] # => "World"

    
### Operation on Types
### Pattern Type []

Creates a regular expression from the given pattern.

Signature:

    PatternCreation
      : 'Pattern' '[' StringExpression ']'
      ;
    StringExpression: Expression ;
    
* The StringExpression must evaluate to a String
* The string pattern must be a valid regular expression
* The string should not include the leading and trailing `/` used in a literal regular expression.

Examples:

    $pattern = Pattern['(f)(o)(o)']  # => /(f)(o)(o)/
    'foo' =~ $pattern                # => true
    notice $1                        # => 'o'

#### Hash Type [ ]
Specialized a Hash Type by producing a new type with parameters for key and value.

* The keys must evaluate to types
* One or two parameters may be given
  * Fewer or more parameters raises an error
* If one type is given the key type is set to Literal, and the value type to the given type
* If two types are given, the key type is the first, and the value type the second
* Note that an unparameterized Hash is really `Hash[Literal, Data]`

Examples:

    Hash[String]                     # => Hash[Literal, String] (type)
    Hash[String, Integer]            # => Hash[String, Integer] (type)
    $h = Hash[String]                # => Hash[Literal, String] (type)
    $h[]                             # => error
    $h[Integer]                      # => Hash[Literal, Integer] (type)

    
#### Array Type [ ]
Specializes an Array Type by producing a new type with specific element type.

* The key must evaluate to a type
* One parameter may be given
  * Fewer or more parameters raises an error
* Note that an unparameterized Array is really `Array[Data]`.

Examples:

    Array                            # => Array[Data]
    Array[String]                    # => Array[String] (type)
    $a = Array[String]               # => Array[String] (type)
    $a[]                             # => error
    $a[Integer]                      # => Array[Integer] (type)
    
#### Class type
Specializes a Class Type by producing a new type that refers to a particular class.

* The key must evaluate to a String
* One parameter may be given
  * Fewer or more parameters raises an error

Examples:

    Class                            # => any class
    Class[apache]                    # => Class[apache] (reference to the class 'apache')
    Class[apache, nginx]             # => [Class[apache], Class[nginx]] (array of classes)
    $c = Class[apache]               # => Class[apache]
    $c[]                             # => error
    
**TODO**:
The expression below when evaluated against a Resource results in lookup of the parameter
value - the same should be done for a class. Also, use the same style of description as for
Resource [] with forms, the Class has two typed (it is a resource of Class type), and reference.
    
    Class[apache][nginx]             # => error cannot make class more special
    
#### Resource Type [ ]

Specializes a Resource Type by producing a new type that refers to a particular subtype
of Resource, or a fully qualified instance of Resource, and when applied to a fully qualified 
Resource the value of a parameter is produced.

A Resource type has three forms:

* *open* - Any Resource
* *typed* - Specific resource type
* *reference* - Specific resource instance reference

These rules apply:

* Accepts one or multiple keys
  * When the form is *open*:
    * The first key must evaluate to a Resource Type (type key)
    * Subsequent (optional) reference keys must evaluate to String
    * Produces a single type when there are fewer than 2 reference keys, and an array of types otherwise
  * When the form is *typed*:
    * The keys are reference keys and must evaluate to String
    * Produces a single type when there are fewer than 2 reference keys, and an array of types otherwise
  * When the form is *reference*:
    * The keys are references to the parameters of the referenced resource and must evaluate to String.
    * Produces a single value when there is a single key, and an array of values otherwise

* In all forms, an error is raised if there are no keys.

Examples:

    Resource                           # => any resource type
    Resource[File]                     # => File
    Resource[File, '/tmp/x']           # => File['/tmp/x']
    Resource[File]['/tmp/x']           # => File['/tmp/x']
    Resource[File, '/tmp/x', '/tmp/y]  # => [File['/tmp/x'], File['/tmp/y']]
    File                               # => File
    File['/tmp/x']                     # => File['/tmp/x']
    File['/tmp/x', '/tmp/y']           # => [File['/tmp/x'], File['/tmp/y']]
    
    File['/tmp/x'][mode]               # => the value of the file /tmp/x's mode parameter
    
The left hand type can be specialized, Resource to a specific type of resource, and a typed resource to a specific (titled) resource.

#### Integer Type [ ]
Produces an array of integers in the given range from, to with an optional step.

* Accepts 2 or three keys
* Keys must evaluate to Integer
* The first key is the start value
* The second key is the end value (inclusive unless stepped over)
* If the second key is smaller than the first key the direction the result is in decending order
* The step may not be negative

Examples:

    Integer[1,3]      # => [1,2,3]
    Integer[3,1]      # => [3.2,1]
    Integer[1,6,2]    # => [1,3,5]
    Integer[6,1,2]    # => [6,4,2]
    Integer[1]        # => error
    Integer[]         # => error
    
    Integer[1,3].each {|x| . . . }   # loop over result
    
**TODO: Note that this serves as an expensive replacement for Range. A proper range implementation would be better.**
  
Function Calls

Conditional Expressions
---
The conditional expressions are R-Value Expressions.

### if (elsif, else) expression

Syntax:

    IfExpression
      : 'if' IfPart
      ;
      
    IfPart
      : TestExpression '{' Statements? '}' ElsePart? 
      ;
      
    ElsePart
      : 'elsif' IfPart
      | 'else' '{' Statements? '}'
      ;
      
    TestExpression : Expression ;  

The TestExpression is evaluated, and if thruty the IfPart Statements are evaluated,
else the ElsePart. If the ElsePart is an IfPart the evaluation recurses until either an
IfPart is evaluated, an unconditional ElsePart is evaluated (if one exists).

* The last evaluated expression in the selected expression block is produced as a result
* If all conditionals evaluated to false, and there was no else part, the produced result is `undef`.

### unless (else) expression

Undef is the equivalence of `if !(TestExpression)`, but does not have an 'elsif' or 'elsunless' part.

Syntax:

    UnlessExpression
      : 'unless' TestExpression '{' Statements? '}' ('else' '{' Statements? '}')?
      ;
      
    TestExpression : Expression ;  


### case expression

A case expression tests a  value Expression against a series of propositions. The first matching
proposition triggers the evaluation of an associated set of statements. If no matching proposition
exists, a default proposition is selected if one exists.

Syntax:

    CaseExpression
      : 'case' Expression '{' Propositions? '}'
      ;
      
    Propositions
      : Option (',' Option)* ':' '{' Statements? '}'
      ;
      
    Option
      : Expression
      | 'default'
      ;

* the case expression is evaluated first
* an option is evaluated before a match is performed      
* A match is computed as:
  * if the option is a Regular Expression the value must be a string for the match to trigger
  * if the option is a Type and the value is not the option matches if the value is an instance of 
    the type.
  * in all other cases, the option matches if the value is equal (using operator `==` semantics)
    to the option value.  
* If one of the options match, the associated Statements are evaluated
* The result of evaluating the last expression in the Statements is produced as result
* If no matching options was found, and one option is the literal default, the Statements associated
  with the Proposition with a default option is selected.
* If no matching Statements were evaluated, the result is `undef`
* The default may appear anywhere in the list of propositions
  
Examples:

    case $observed {
    
      'cat', 'sylvester': { 
        notice 'I taw a puddy cat'
      }
      
      'seed': {
        notice 'Feed me!'
      }
      
      'toe': {
        notice 'This widdle piddy went to market' 
      }
    }

    notice case $name {
    
      'paul', 'ringo', 'george', 'john': { 
        'The Beatles'
       }
       
      'mick', 'keith', 'charlie', 'ronnie': {
        'The Rolling Stones'
      }
      default: { 'Some other band' }
    }

### ? (selector) expression

Matches a LHS expression against a sequence of propositions. The value expression associated
with the matching option expression is evaluated and produced as the result.

Syntax:

    SelectorExpression
      : Expression '?' (Proposition | Propositions)
      ;
      
    Proposition
      : Option '=>' Value
      ;
      
    Propositions
      : '{' Proposition (',' Proposition)* ','? '}'
      ;
      
    Option: Expression ;
    Value: Expression ;

* The selector expression is evaluated first
* the Option expressions are processed from top to bottom
  * the option expression is evaluated
  * The proposition matches if the option is the literal `default`, or if the option
    matches using the same match semantics as case proposition
  * The result of the value expression is the result of the selector expression if the proposition
    was matched.
* If no match was found, the result of the selector expression is `undef`. 

Example:

    # Ex 1.
    $x = $y ? sad => blue
    # the same as
    $x = if $y == sad { blue }
    
    # Ex 2.
    $x = $y ? {
      hot     => red,
      sad     => blue,
      seasick => green,
      default => normal,
    }
    # The same as
    $x = case $y {
      hot: { red }
      sad: { blue }
      seasick: { green }
      default: { normal }
    }
    


Catalog Expressions
---
Catalog Expressions are those that more directly relate to the content of the catalog produced
by the compilation of a Puppet Program.

* Node Definition - associates the logic producing a particular catalog with the node making 
  a request for a catalog.
* Class Definition - creates a grouping of resources
* Resource Type Definition - creates a new (User) Resource Type
* Resource Expression - creates resources
* Resource Default Expression - sets default values for resources
* Resource Override Expression - sets
* Relationship operators - orders the entries in the catalog

This chapter focuses on the syntactic aspects of these expressions. There are additional semantic rules, rules specific per type (extensible set), evaluation order semantics, as well as semantics for
catalog application that are covered in a separate chapter. (TODO: REF TO THIS CHAPTER).
