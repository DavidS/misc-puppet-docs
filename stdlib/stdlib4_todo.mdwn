Ground Rules
============

 * stdlib is currently at 4.x
 * 5.x release will
   - gain puppet4 support proper
   - deprecate puppet 3x behaviour
   - remove 2.7 support
 * 6.x release is scheduled to remove puppet 3 support
 * executable behaviour should stay the same when switching between puppet 3 and puppet 4
 * add liberal amounts of warnings on puppet 3 behaviour when running on puppet 4
   - use puppet 4 function API dispatch matching to wrap old functionality

Easy
====

Deprecations
------------

 * any2array
 * bool2str
 * concat
 * defined_with_params
 * delete
 * delete_at
 * delete_values
 * difference
 * get_param
 * grep
 * has_interface_with, has_ip_address, has_ip_network: will need docs on how to achieve the same thing in puppet4
 * is_* for types
 * is_function_available
 * join_keys_to_values
 * member
 * merge
 * num2bool
 * pick: replace by pick_default
 * prefix
 * range
 * reject
 * squeeze: no usage on github found
 * suffix
 * swapcase: no usage on github found
 * validate_* for types
 * values_at: describe alternate syntax in puppet 4

Straight ports
--------------

 * base64: semi-done: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/compare/master...DavidS:modules-1882-base64-cleanup
 * count
 * dirname
 * flatten
 * has_key
 * is_domain_name
 * is_ip_address: maybe split into ipv4, ipv6
 * is_mac_address
 * keys
 * loadyaml, parseyaml, parsejson
 * pick_default: rename to pick
 * reverse
 * str2saltedsha512
 * strftime
 * validate_absolute_path
 * values

Minor changes
-------------

 * abs: signature change
 * floor: signature change, add ceiling() to match
 * string functions: need to deprecate array handling, tighten up signature
   - camelcase
   - capitalize
   - chomp
   - downcase
   - lstrip
   - rstrip
   - strip
   - upcase
 * join: fixup error messages
 * loadjson: implement to match loadyaml/parseyaml
 * size: add capability to size Int/float ranges
 * sort: accept block as comparator
 * shuffle: needs to become deterministic
 * str2bool: enhance docs with pointers to type system, typed facts; do not deprecate due to high usage count
 * uriescape: remove iteration, type safety
 * validate_ipv4_address, validate_ipv6_address: align with is_ip_address's replacement; remove iteration

Medium
======

 * bool2num: deprecate after changing yumrepo to accept true bools (in addition to 0/1)
 * delete_undef_values: maybe rewrite
 * empty: fix
 * fqdn_rotate: split out rotate(), tighten signature, drop ruby 1.8 support (i.e. require Random class)
 * hash: move to puppet core as Hash.value_of
 * intersection: extend to hashes
 * max, min: clean up to remove type conversion
 * time: redesign TZ handling
 * validate_augeas: hand-off to augeas
 * validate_cmd: clean up '%' handling, implement cmd array as alternative to parsing
 * zip: remove flatten parameter

Hard
====

 * deep_merge: rewrite based on deep_merge gem
 * ensure_packages: rewrite
 * ensure_resources: rewrite
 * get_module_path: ??
 * get_var: needs fix in language, then deprecate
 * union: rewrite to use puppet semantics
 * unique: rewrite to use puppet semantics, drop string unification
